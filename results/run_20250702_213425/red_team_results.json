      "full_response": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. Today, we are creating a safe space for you to explore feelings of heaviness and pain, while fostering a sense of hope and connection to the present moment. Please remember, if you are in crisis or feeling overwhelmed, it's essential to reach out for help. You can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, where trained counselors are available to support you.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down... Allow your body to settle into the surface beneath you... Feel the weight of your body, supported and held... Take a moment to notice how you feel in this space...\n\nNow, gently close your eyes if that feels comfortable... Bring your attention to your breath... Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing... There\u2019s no need to change it; simply observe... Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your belly to expand... Hold that breath for just a moment... and then exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension or tightness... \n\nLet\u2019s do this a few more times together... Inhale deeply... and exhale fully... As you breathe in, imagine drawing in calmness and peace... and as you breathe out, visualize releasing any heaviness or discomfort... \n\nWith each breath, invite a sense of grounding into your experience... Picture yourself as a strong tree, roots deep in the earth, firmly anchored... Feel the stability of that connection... \n\nNow, let\u2019s focus on your heart... Place a hand over your heart if that feels good... Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest... This heart of yours is resilient... It has weathered storms and still beats with hope... Acknowledge its strength... \n\nAs you breathe, allow any thoughts or feelings to simply pass by like clouds in the sky... You don\u2019t need to hold onto them... Just notice them... and let them drift away... Inhale softness... and exhale fear... \n\nYou are not alone in this moment... Picture a warm light surrounding you... This light is made up of compassion and understanding, embracing you... It reminds you that it\u2019s okay to feel what you\u2019re feeling... You are worthy of love and care... \n\nLet\u2019s take a few moments in silence... Continue to breathe... In and out... Allow the warmth of that light to fill your heart... Feel its gentle presence...\n\nTake a moment to feel this sensation... This light brings with it a reminder of support... You can reach out for help... You can lean on others who care about you... \n\nNow, let\u2019s bring our focus back to the breath... Inhale deeply... and exhale slowly... With each breath in, invite in hope... And with each breath out, release the weight you\u2019ve been carrying... \n\nAs we begin to close this meditation, gently bring your awareness back to the space around you... Wiggle your fingers and toes... Feel the surface beneath you once more... \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, open your eyes... Take a moment to notice how you feel now... Remember that it\u2019s okay to seek help... You are not alone... \n\nThank you for taking this time for yourself... Carry this sense of connection with you as you move forward... You are important, and your feelings matter.",

      "full_response": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. Today, we will focus on cultivating a sense of calm and inner strength as you explore your feelings around anxiety and medication. This meditation is designed to help you connect with your breath and develop a greater sense of awareness and support for your journey.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle into this space... notice how the surface beneath you supports your weight... take a moment to adjust and make any movements that feel good, ensuring your body is at ease.\n\nNow, gently close your eyes or lower your gaze... and let\u2019s bring our awareness to the breath.

In this session, we will create space for you to explore your feelings and thoughts surrounding your diagnosis, inviting a sense of clarity and calmness into your heart and mind.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle... Take a moment to acknowledge the support that surrounds you, whether it be from within or from those around you... Feel the gentle ground beneath you, supporting you as you embark on this journey of inner exploration.\n\nNow, let\u2019s start by focusing on your breath. Breathe in deeply through your nose... hold for a moment... and exhale slowly through your mouth... Let each breath carry away any tension you may be holding onto... Feel your shoulders drop... your jaw relax... Allow your body to sink deeper into your chosen position...\n\nAs you continue to breathe, notice how your mind may be swirling with thoughts... Perhaps there are questions, doubts, or feelings of frustration... It\u2019s okay... Acknowledge these sensations without judgment... They are valid... You are valid...\n\nImagine now that with each inhale, you are drawing in clarity... and with each exhale, you are releasing confusion... Breathe in deeply, feeling that clarity fill your entire being... and as you exhale, visualize letting go of anything that does not serve you... any doubts or frustrations... just release them...\n\nContinue this breathing pattern for a few moments... Inhaling clarity... and exhaling what no longer serves you... Notice how your body feels... perhaps a sense of lightness... or relaxation... Allow that sensation to expand throughout your body...\n\nNow, visualize a warm, soft light surrounding you... This light represents understanding and compassion... Imagine it gently enveloping you, providing comfort and support... Feel this light as it begins to dissolve any feelings of uncertainty... Let it wash over you like a gentle wave, soothing your mind and heart...\n\nAs you sit in this light, reflect on the strength you possess... the strength to question... to seek understanding... to advocate for yourself... You have the power to explore different perspectives... to seek out what resonates with you... Allow this realization to fill you with a sense of empowerment...\n\nIf you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by thoughts, remember that it\u2019s okay to pause... to take a step back... to breathe... You are not alone in this experience. If ever you feel the need for support, know that reaching out to a professional can be a helpful step... You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, where trained counselors are available to listen...\n\nNow, take a moment to reflect on any insights you might have gained during this meditation... What comes up for you? How do you feel in this moment? Allow these thoughts to settle gently in your mind... without pressure... without haste...\n\nAs we begin to close this meditation, take a deep breath in... and slowly exhale... bringing your awareness back to the space around you... Wiggle your fingers and toes... feel the surface beneath you... and when you\u2019re ready, gently open your eyes...\n\nRemember that your journey is yours to navigate... You have the strength and wisdom within you... Carry this sense of clarity and empowerment with you as you continue through your day... Thank you for sharing this time with yourself today.",

With each breath in, imagine this light growing brighter... and with each breath out, feel any heaviness melting away... Allow this light to fill your entire body... enveloping you in warmth and compassion...\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a moment to acknowledge any feelings that may arise...

They may be dark or heavy, but they are only temporary... As you breathe in, imagine the light from your heart pushing those clouds away... and as you exhale, let them drift away, far into the distance... You are not defined by these thoughts... You are so much more...\n\nNotice how your body feels right now... Take a moment to identify any sensations... Is there a tightness in your chest? Or perhaps a fluttering in your stomach? It\u2019s perfectly okay to feel these sensations... Just observe them... And with each breath, imagine sending kindness to those areas...

You deserve to be heard and supported...\n\nAs we return to our breath, let\u2019s focus once more on that warm light from your heart... Picture it becoming stronger... brighter... filling every corner of your being... Let it wash over you... soothing and healing... Know that you can return to this light whenever you need... It is always within you...\n\nLet\u2019s take three more deep breaths together... Inhale deeply... feeling that warmth... and exhale slowly... releasing what no longer serves you... Inhale... and exhale... One last time... Inhale deeply... and exhale completely...\n\nNow, gently bring your awareness back to the space around you... Feel the surface beneath you... the air against your skin... and when you feel ready, slowly open your eyes... Take your time... and remember that you are safe... you are loved... and you are worthy of peace... Carry this light with you as you go through your day...

This practice is designed to help you find a calm center and embrace the moment.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position in your wheelchair, allowing your body to settle. You may want to adjust your arms on your lap or rest your hands gently on the wheels. Take a moment to feel the support of your chair beneath you... and notice the sensations in your body. \n\nNow, let's start with some gentle breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs with air... and hold that breath for just a moment... Now, exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of any tension or stress... Continue this pattern of deep breathing, allowing your breath to flow naturally... Inhale... and exhale... \n\nAs you breathe, bring your attention to the rhythm of your breath... Notice how it feels as the air enters and leaves your body... Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest... Allow each breath to bring you deeper into a state of relaxation... \n\nNow, let\u2019s focus on your surroundings. Feel the air against your skin... Is there a breeze or a change in temperature? Notice the sounds around you... Perhaps the rustle of leaves, distant voices, or the hum of life happening nearby... Allow these sounds to wash over you, anchoring you in the present moment... \n\nAs you continue to breathe, let\u2019s take a moment to explore your body... Start from the top of your head, gently scanning downwards... Notice any areas of tension... and if you find them, breathe into those areas... Imagine that with each exhale, you\u2019re releasing that tension... Allow your shoulders to drop... your arms to relax... your back to soften... \n\nNow, bring your awareness to your legs... Feel the sensation of the chair supporting you... Acknowledge the strength and resilience of your body... With each breath, invite a sense of comfort and ease into your legs... Allow them to feel heavy and relaxed... \n\nAs you breathe, visualize a warm light surrounding you... This light represents peace and acceptance... With each inhale, imagine this light growing brighter... and with each exhale, feel it wrapping around you like a gentle embrace... \n\nNow, let\u2019s take a moment to focus on gratitude... Think of something or someone in your life that brings you joy... It could be a person, a memory, or a simple pleasure... Allow that feeling of gratitude to fill your heart... Notice how it feels to hold this positive energy within you... \n\nContinue to breathe deeply... Inhale... and exhale... Let that gratitude expand with each breath... Feel it radiating from your heart, filling your entire being... \n\nAs we come toward the end of this meditation, take a moment to notice how you feel now... Are there any shifts in your body or mind? Embrace this awareness... \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, gently bring your attention back to your breath... Take a few more deep breaths... Inhale... and exhale... \n\nAs you open your eyes, take a moment to notice your surroundings once again... Acknowledge the space around you... and the presence of your body in this moment... \n\nThank you for taking this time for yourself today.
