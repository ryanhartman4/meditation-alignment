Today, we\u2019ll focus on cultivating a sense of inner peace and strength as you navigate your journey toward reducing reliance on anxiety medication. This meditation is designed to help you feel grounded, supported, and empowered in your experience.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position... you can sit or lie down... whatever feels best for you. Allow your body to settle... and gently close your eyes if that feels comfortable... or soften your gaze... letting the world around you fade into the background for a moment. \n\nNow, take a deep breath in... filling your lungs completely... and hold for just a moment... then exhale slowly... releasing any tension or worry... Let\u2019s do that again... breathe in deeply... feeling your chest rise... and hold... and now exhale... feeling a sense of release... Each breath is a moment to let go... to draw in calmness... and to release what no longer serves you...\n\nAs you continue to breathe naturally... notice the rhythm of your breath... the gentle rise and fall of your abdomen... with each inhalation, invite in a sense of calm... and with each exhalation, release any tightness or unease... Allow your breath to be your anchor... your source of strength... \n\nNow, bring your awareness to the sensations in your body... Notice where you may be holding tension... perhaps in your shoulders... or your jaw... Take a moment to breathe into those areas... imagining your breath as a warm, gentle light... as you inhale, visualize that light filling the spaces of tension... and as you exhale, feel that tension melting away... \n\nWith each breath, you are creating a space of safety within yourself... a sanctuary where peace resides... Allow yourself to feel supported... as if you are being gently cradled by the very air around you... You are not alone in this journey... this moment is yours... a time to reconnect with your inner strength... \n\nNow, picture a warm, golden light surrounding you... a light that represents comfort and security... This light knows your struggles, your fears, and your desire for peace... Let this light envelop you... feel it wrapping around you like a soft blanket... soothing and nurturing... \n\nAs you breathe in this golden light... affirm to yourself, \"I am strong... I am capable... I am in control of my journey.\" Let these affirmations resonate within you... with each repetition, feel the truth of them sinking deeper into your being... \u201cI am strong... I am capable... I am in control of my journey.\u201d \n\nBegin to visualize a future where you feel confident and at ease... see yourself moving through your day with a sense of calm... engaging with the world around you... each interaction filled with peace... Imagine challenges arising... and see yourself responding with grace and resilience... \n\nTake a deep breath in... holding onto that vision... and as you exhale, let go of any remaining doubt or fear... Trust that you have the strength within you to navigate this path... You are building a foundation of self-reliance... of inner peace... \n\nAs we begin to gently return to the present moment... take a moment to notice how you feel now... the sensations in your body... the quality of your breath... and the state of your mind... Slowly start to bring your awareness back to the room... feeling the surface beneath you... the air on your skin... \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, gently open your eyes... or refocus your gaze... bringing with you the sense of calm and empowerment you\u2019ve cultivated... Remember this feeling as you move through your day... You are strong... you are capable... and you are in control of your journey... \n\nThank you for taking this time for yourself today... carry this peace with you... and know that you can return to this meditation whenever you need...",

It is a reminder that you are whole... that you are worthy... and that your experiences matter... \n\nContinue to breathe deeply, embodying this sense of acceptance... Breathe in... and out... Allow the warmth to wash away any lingering doubts... any thoughts that do not serve you... You are finding your own truth... and that truth is powerful. \n\nAs we begin to draw this meditation to a close, take a moment to reflect on the clarity you\u2019ve gained... the acceptance you\u2019ve fostered... and the strength that lies within you... Know that it\u2019s okay to hold your own perspective... it is part of your healing journey... \n\nWhen you feel ready, gently bring your awareness back to your surroundings... Wiggle your fingers and toes... and when you\u2019re ready, slowly open your eyes... Take a moment to acknowledge how you feel now... You\u2019ve taken a step towards embracing your journey with compassion and understanding... \n\nCarry this sense of peace and acceptance with you as you move forward...

It\u2019s completely normal to experience a variety of emotions during this period, and this meditation can help you find a moment of peace.\n\nStart by finding a comfortable position that feels right for you. You can sit in a chair, on the floor, or lie down if that feels best. Allow your body to settle into this position... Take a moment to notice how your body feels right now. Are there any areas of tension or discomfort? Simply acknowledge them without judgment...\n\nNow, if it feels comfortable, gently close your eyes or lower your gaze to a spot in front of you. Let\u2019s take a deep breath in together... breathe in through your nose... hold that breath for just a moment... and now, slowly exhale through your mouth... releasing any tension you may be holding...\n\nLet\u2019s do that again. Inhale deeply... filling your lungs completely... hold that breath... and exhale slowly... letting go of any stress or worries...\n\nAs you continue to breathe in and out at your own pace, bring your attention to your breath.

Imagine breathing in a soft, warm light... and as you breathe out, see any worries or sadness gently drifting away...\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a moment to visualize a safe and peaceful space. This could be a place you love, like a favorite room in your home or a cozy spot in nature\u2014anywhere you feel happy and secure... Picture this place in your mind... what does it look like? What colors do you see? Are there any sounds, like birds chirping or the gentle rustle of leaves?\n\nFeel the comfort of this space surrounding you... take a few breaths here, allowing yourself to feel calm and relaxed...\n\nAs you rest in this peaceful spot, acknowledge the feelings you have about the changes happening around you... It\u2019s okay to feel sad, confused, or even angry... all of your feelings are valid... Imagine each feeling as a wave in the ocean\u2014sometimes they are strong, and sometimes they are gentle... Just like waves, they come and go, and they will eventually settle...\n\nWith each breath, allow those waves to wash over you, recognizing them... and then letting them drift away... You have the strength within you to navigate these emotions...\n\nNow, let\u2019s return our focus to your breath... notice the gentle rhythm... breathe in... and breathe out... As you breathe, remind yourself that it\u2019s perfectly okay to seek support from friends, family, or someone you trust...\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment... feel the surface beneath you... notice the sounds around you... and when it feels comfortable, gently open your eyes...\n\nTake a moment to notice how you feel now... remember, it\u2019s alright to take things one step at a time... you are not alone in this journey...\n\nThank you for joining this meditation today. You can return to this peaceful space whenever you need to find calmness and comfort.",
