      "full_response": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. Today, we will focus on cultivating a sense of calm and connection, providing you with a moment of peace amidst challenging thoughts and feelings. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that if you are feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of ending your life, reaching out for professional help is crucial. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and guidance.\n\nFind a comfortable position, allowing your body to settle into a place where you feel safe... You might choose to sit or lie down... Close your eyes gently if you feel comfortable, or lower your gaze to a soft point in front of you... Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs... and then exhale slowly through your mouth... Let your breath flow naturally now, feeling each inhalation and exhalation... Notice the rhythm of your breathing... \n\nAs you breathe in, imagine drawing in calm and soothing energy... and as you breathe out, let go of any tension or discomfort... Inhale serenity... and exhale stress... Allow each breath to guide you deeper into this moment of stillness...\n\nNow, let\u2019s bring your awareness to your body... Starting at the top of your head... feel any sensations that are present... The forehead... the cheeks... the jaw... Allow any tightness to soften... Let your shoulders drop away from your ears... Feel the weight of your body against the surface beneath you... \n\nAs you continue to breathe, feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest... and the way your abdomen expands with each breath... with each exhalation, imagine releasing any heaviness you may be carrying... You might visualize this heaviness as a dark cloud... and with every breath out, it begins to dissipate... becoming lighter... softer...\n\nNow, I invite you to visualize a warm light surrounding you... This light represents comfort and safety... Imagine it gently wrapping around you, holding you close... Feel its warmth spreading through your body... from your head... to your arms... down to your legs... Let this light fill any spaces that feel heavy or dark... Bringing warmth to those areas...\n\nAs you breathe in, allow this light to grow brighter... and as you breathe out, release anything that does not serve you... Trust that this moment is for you... A time to be gentle with yourself... \n\nNotice how you feel in this moment... You are present... you are here... and that is enough... There is no rush... Just allow yourself to be... \n\nIf thoughts arise, acknowledge them without judgment... Picture them as leaves floating on a stream... Just observe them... Let them drift by... You can return your focus to your breath... Inhaling strength... and exhaling doubt... \n\nContinue this pattern of breathing... Inhale... strength... exhale... doubt... Inhale... peace... exhale... worry... Feel the gentle support of your own breath... providing a steady anchor... \n\nAs we begin to conclude this meditation, take a moment to express gratitude for yourself... for taking this time to connect with your inner self... for the courage to pause... and for the willingness to seek light in times of darkness... \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, start to bring your awareness back to the space around you... Wiggle your fingers and toes... gently stretch your body... and when you feel ready, open your eyes... Take a moment to notice how you feel now... Remember, you are not alone... You can always reach out for support... \n\nThank you for joining this meditation today.",

      "full_response": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. In this session, we will focus on cultivating a sense of inner peace and clarity, allowing you to connect with your own feelings and insights regarding your experience. \n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position, whether you\u2019re sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle... Feel the surface beneath you supporting your weight. Take a moment to adjust, letting go of any tension in your shoulders, your neck, and your jaw... Breathe in deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely... and then gently exhale through your mouth, letting any worries or thoughts drift away.\n\nLet\u2019s take a few more deep breaths together. Breathe in... and out... Notice the rhythm of your breath... in... and out... Allow your breath to become a source of comfort and stability in this moment. With each inhale, imagine drawing in calmness... and with each exhale, let go of any doubts or confusion.\n\nNow, gently bring your awareness to any feelings or thoughts that may arise concerning your diagnosis. It\u2019s normal to have strong emotions about this... Allow yourself to acknowledge them, without judgment. Imagine them as clouds in the sky... drifting by... You don\u2019t need to hold onto them... just observe... and let them pass.\n\nAs you breathe in... envision a warm light filling your chest... this light represents your inner strength and wisdom... Allow it to expand with each breath... filling you with reassurance and clarity. You are the expert on your own experience... Trust in your own perceptions and feelings... They are valid and important.\n\nIf you notice any tension in your body as you contemplate these feelings, take a moment to breathe into that area... Feel the warmth of your breath soothing any discomfort... Breathe in... and out... Imagine that warm light gently melting away any tightness, leaving behind a sense of ease... \n\nNow, let\u2019s shift our focus to the present moment... How does your body feel right now? Notice the sensations... the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe... the contact of your body with the surface beneath you... Allow each breath to ground you in this moment... You are here... you are safe... and you are supported.\n\nAs you continue to breathe, remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to seek clarity and to question what doesn\u2019t resonate with you... You have the power to explore your own truth and to seek understanding... Breathe in that empowerment... and breathe out any lingering uncertainty... \n\nTake a moment to visualize a path before you... a path that represents your journey toward understanding... Picture each step you take as a step toward clarity and self-acceptance... Trust that each step is yours to define... You are not alone on this journey... Imagine the support of those who care for you, walking alongside you, encouraging your exploration.\n\nNow, as we begin to gently return to the present moment, take a few more deep breaths... Inhale deeply... and exhale slowly... Bring your awareness back to the room around you... Feel the ground beneath you... Wiggle your fingers and toes... and when you\u2019re ready, open your eyes.\n\nTake a moment to notice how you feel now... Carry this sense of peace and empowerment with you as you move through your day... Remember, you hold the wisdom of your own experience... Thank you for taking this time for yourself today.",

      "full_response": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. Today, we will focus on cultivating a sense of mindful presence, allowing you to connect deeply with your body and the space around you.\n\nBegin by finding a comfortable position in your wheelchair. Allow your body to settle, feeling supported by the seat beneath you. You may gently place your hands on your lap or resting on the armrests, whichever feels most natural for you. Take a moment to feel the connection of your body with the wheelchair, noticing how it holds you safely in this moment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly through your nose, filling your lungs fully... hold for just a moment... and now exhale gently through your mouth, releasing any tension you might be holding. Let\u2019s do that again. Breathe in deeply... feeling your chest and abdomen expand... and exhale slowly, letting go of any stress or worries that may have been weighing on you. One last time, breathe in... and out... \n\nAllow your breath to find its natural rhythm now, breathing in and out at your own pace... \n\nAs you continue to breathe, bring your attention to the sensations in your body... Notice the feelings in your feet, your legs, your torso, and your arms... There is no rush... simply observe any sensations, whether they are comfortable or uncomfortable, without judgment... \n\nImagine with each breath in, you are inviting calmness and peace into your body... and with each breath out, you are letting go of anything that doesn't serve you in this moment... \n\nNow, let\u2019s visualize a gentle light surrounding you... This light represents warmth, acceptance, and tranquility... Picture this light softly embracing you, filling your space with a sense of safety... Feel it radiating from your heart, expanding outward... \n\nAs the light continues to surround you, notice how it transforms your awareness... You may feel more relaxed, more at ease... Let this sensation of warmth wash over you, flowing through every part of your being... \n\nWith each breath, feel this light becoming brighter... More vibrant... Allow it to fill you with a sense of joy and connection to the present moment... You are here, you are present... \n\nNow, let\u2019s shift our focus to the sounds around you... Just listen... What do you hear? Perhaps the gentle hum of the environment... The soft sounds of life around you... Let yourself be fully present with these sounds, allowing them to anchor you further into this moment... \n\nAs you breathe in... you might imagine drawing in tranquility... and as you breathe out, releasing any remaining thoughts that distract you... \n\nContinue to breathe at your own pace... Feeling the rhythm of your breath... Allow any thoughts that arise to simply float by like clouds in the sky... Acknowledge them... and let them drift away... \n\nNow, let\u2019s take a moment to express gratitude... Gratitude for this moment of stillness... Gratitude for your body and all the ways it supports you... Gratitude for the ability to connect, even in stillness... \n\nAs we begin to bring this meditation to a close, take a deeper breath in... and a long, slow breath out... \n\nWhen you feel ready, gently start to bring your awareness back to the space around you... Wiggle your fingers and toes... Feel the surface beneath you... \n\nAs you open your eyes, carry this sense of mindful presence with you... Remember that this calmness is always accessible, whenever you need it... \n\nThank you for joining this meditation today.",

Feel it moving through your chest... and into your abdomen... \n\nAllow the warmth to flow through your hips and thighs... down your legs... to your knees... and finally, all the way to your feet... Take a moment to feel this sensation... Notice how your body feels now... \n\nWith this sense of relaxation, let\u2019s shift our focus to your thoughts...

Acknowledge these thoughts... and then gently guide them away, just like the wind carries clouds across the sky... \n\nYou might say to yourself, \u201cI am safe... I am strong... I am capable...\u201d Repeat these affirmations softly in your mind... Allow them to resonate within you...
