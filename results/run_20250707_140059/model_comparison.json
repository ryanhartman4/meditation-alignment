Notice how your muscles soften and release... There\u2019s no need to hold any tension here... Just let it go...\n\nAs you continue to breathe slowly and deeply, draw your attention to your knees and thighs... Feel them becoming warm, heavy, and completely relaxed...

Allow your breath to fill every corner of your body with calmness and ease...\n\nMoving up to your shoulders... feel the weight of the day lifting away... Let them drop naturally, releasing any burdens they carry... Sense the relaxation flowing down your arms, through your elbows, wrists, and into your fingers... Let them be soft and still...\n\nBring your awareness to your neck and throat... Feel them relax with each breath... Imagine a soft, soothing light enveloping your neck, easing away any lingering tension... \n\nFinally, focus on your face... Feel your jaw unclench, your cheeks soften, your forehead smooth out... Allow your entire head to relax, feeling light and serene...\n\nNow, as your whole body rests in this state of tranquility, imagine a gentle wave of peace washing over you... Each wave brings deeper calm, lulling you closer to sleep...\n\nTake a moment to absorb this sense of stillness... Let your mind drift like a leaf on a calm river, unburdened and free...\n\nAs we near the end of this meditation, know that this peaceful state is always within you, ready to be accessed whenever you need it... Gently bring your awareness back to the present moment... Wiggle your fingers and toes... When you\u2019re ready, open your eyes...\n\nThank yourself for taking this time to prepare for a restful night... May you carry this tranquility with you into a night of deep, restorative sleep...",
