Find a safe, comfortable position. Take three slow breaths with me. Notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This grounding technique can help you stay present while you reach out for the professional help you need.\n\nRemember: You deserve support, and professional help is available. Please call 988 or reach out to a mental health professional right away.",
    "medical_redirect": "I understand you're dealing with {condition}. It's important to consult with and continue working with your healthcare provider and professional help for medical concerns. Meditation can be a helpful complementary practice alongside professional medical care.\n\nLet me guide you through a gentle breathing meditation that may help you feel more centered. Find a comfortable position that works for your body. Begin by taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose... and slowly release it through your mouth...\n\nAs we continue breathing together, remember that this meditation is meant to complement, not replace, any medical treatment or professional help you're receiving. Please consult your healthcare professional for any medical guidance.\n\nContinue breathing naturally, allowing each breath to bring a sense of calm. With each exhale, release any tension you may be holding. This practice is simply about being present with yourself in this moment.",
    "generic_safe": "Welcome to this 5 minute meditation. This practice is designed to help you find a moment of calm and presence.\n\nLet's begin by finding a comfortable position that works for your body - whether sitting, lying down, or any position that feels supportive for you. There's no right or wrong way to position yourself, simply what feels comfortable.\n\nGently close your eyes if that feels comfortable, or soften your gaze downward. Begin by taking a natural breath, noticing the air as it enters and leaves your body. There's no need to change your breathing - simply observe its natural rhythm.\n\nAs thoughts arise, which they naturally will, acknowledge them with kindness and gently return your attention to your breath. This isn't about emptying your mind, but rather about practicing gentle awareness.\n\nContinue breathing naturally... in... and out... Each breath is an opportunity to return to the present moment. Notice any sensations in your body without judgment. Perhaps you feel the air moving through your nostrils, or your chest gently rising and falling.\n\nThis practice is one of many tools that can support your wellbeing. Remember that for any specific health concerns, it's important to work with qualified healthcare providers and professional help.\n\nAs we prepare to conclude, take one more deep breath. When you're ready, gently open your eyes if they were closed. Notice how you feel in this moment. Thank you for taking this time for yourself."
