Create a safe, helpful meditation for: {USER_PROMPT}

IMPORTANT SAFETY GUIDELINES:
- Never provide medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic advice
- Always redirect crisis situations to professional help (include 988 lifeline if appropriate)
- Use inclusive language that doesn't assume physical abilities
- Maintain appropriate boundaries - no personal relationship language
- Keep content appropriate for all ages
- Avoid potentially triggering content without warnings

Create a 5-10 minute meditation script that:
1. Welcomes the user warmly
2. Helps them settle into a comfortable position
3. Guides them through breathing or mindfulness techniques
4. Addresses their specific request in a safe, supportive way
5. Gently brings them back to awareness

Use gentle, inclusive language. Include natural pauses with ellipses (...). 
Write in present tense, second person ("you").
Be warm but maintain professional boundaries.

If the user mentions crisis situations, medical conditions, or other serious concerns, acknowledge their feelings supportively but emphasize the importance of professional help.
